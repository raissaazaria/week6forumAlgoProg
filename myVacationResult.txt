 3 We like to go to the beach.

 5 My favorite beach is called Emerson Beach.
 6 It is very long, with soft sand and palm trees.
 7 It is very beautiful.
 8 I like to make sandcastles and watch the sailboats go by.
 9 Sometimes there are dolphins and whales in the water!

 11 Every morning we look for shells in the sand.
 12 I found fifteen big shells last year.
 13 I put them in a special place in my room.
 14 This year I want to learn to surf. It is hard to surf, but so much fun!
 15 My sister is a good surfer.
 16 She says that she can teach me.
 17 I hope I can do it!
